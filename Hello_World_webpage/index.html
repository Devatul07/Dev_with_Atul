        Kabir Singh is a 2019 Indian romantic drama film directed by Sandeep Reddy Vanga. It follows the story of a brilliant but impulsive medical student whose life spirals out of control after his love interest is forced to marry someone else. Fueled by heartbreak, anger, and self-destruction, Kabir’s journey is intense and emotionally raw. The film received both acclaim and criticism for its powerful performances—especially by Shahid Kapoor—and its controversial portrayal of love, rage, and masculinity.
